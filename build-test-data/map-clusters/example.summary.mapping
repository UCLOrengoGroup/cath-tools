Domain Mapping
==

This section describes how well the map-from domains could be mapped to new domains (and vice versa).
The quality of a mapping between a pair of domains is defined as the percentage overlap over the longer
domain (ie the percentage of the longer domain's residues shared with the other domain).
In this run, the cut-off for defining domain-equivalence was 60.0%.

Cluster Mapping
==

This section describes how well the old clusters could be mapped to the new clusters (and vice versa).
The quality of a mapping between a pair of clusters is defined as the percentage of the domains in
the map-from cluster that have an equivalent domain in the new cluster.
In this run, the cutoff for defining cluster-equivalence was 60.0%.

Also, for clusters to be considered equivalents, the map-from cluster's members must
be equivalent to > 20% of the working cluster's entries and > 50% of those that have an equivalence.
