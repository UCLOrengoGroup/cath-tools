About
-----

Protein structure tools such as SSAP, as used by the [Orengo Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/orengo-group "Orengo Group website") in the curation of [CATH](http://www.cathdb.info/ "CATH website").

SSAP algorithm (`cath-ssap`) devised by Christine A Orengo and William R Taylor. Please cite: *Protein Structure Alignment*, Taylor and Orengo, Journal of Molecular Biology 208, 1-22, PMID: 2769748.

Since then, many people have contributed to this code, most notably:
  * Tony E Lewis               (2011  - ....)
  * Oliver C Redfern           (~2003 - 2011)
  * James E Bray, Ian Sillitoe (~2000 - 2003)
  * Andrew C R Martin          (considerable edits around 2001)







Cloning the cath-tools GitHub Repo
---

This project includes [bioplib](https://github.com/ACRMGroup/bioplib "Bioplib's GitHub homepage") as a submodule. To ensure the bioplib directory gets populated, clone with:

~~~~~no-highlight
git clone --recursive https://github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/cath-tools.git
~~~~~

...or if you've already cloned, then use:


~~~~~no-highlight
git submodule update --init --recursive
~~~~~

Quickstart: Running SSAP
========================

The binary for SSAP is called `cath-ssap` and it'll tell you its usage if you run `cath-ssap --help`.

You'll need to tell it where to find the PDB, wolf and sec files. We recommend you use the path options to manage your list of directories to search. This can be done with command line options, but it may be easier to add suitable environment variables to your profile:

~~~~~no-highlight
CATH_TOOLS_PDB_PATH  .:/global/data/directories/pdb
CATH_TOOLS_DSSP_PATH .:/global/data/directories/dssp
CATH_TOOLS_SEC_PATH  .:/global/data/directories/sec
~~~~~

Similarly, if you use a different style of prefix/suffix for your files, you can specify these with command line options or with these environment variables:

~~~~~no-highlight
CATH_TOOLS_PDB_PREFIX
CATH_TOOLS_DSSP_PREFIX
CATH_TOOLS_SEC_PREFIX
CATH_TOOLS_PDB_SUFFIX
CATH_TOOLS_DSSP_SUFFIX
CATH_TOOLS_SEC_SUFFIX
~~~~~

The cath-superpose tool makes superpositions that look better (but have higher RMSDs). You can pass it the alignment generated by cath-ssap as follows:

~~~~~no-highlight
./cath-ssap 1cukA 1bvsA
./cath-superpose --ssap-aln-infile 1cukA1bvsA.list --pdb-infile /global/data/directories/pdb/1cukA --pdb-infile /global/data/directories/pdb/1bvsA --sup-to-pymol
~~~~~

Extra Bioplib Notes
-------------------

At present, the [bioplib](https://github.com/ACRMGroup/bioplib "Bioplib's GitHub Homepage") submodule is v2.1.2. If you attempt to use &ge; v3.0, be sure to comment out the line in the Makefile that switches on use of libxml2:

~~~~~no-highlight
# Include libxml2
# Note: xml2-config is installed with libxml2
#       Link to libxml2 with -lxml2
COPT := $(COPT) -D XML_SUPPORT $(shell xml2-config --cflags)
~~~~~

(otherwise the build against the bioplib libraries will be broken by unresolved dependencies to libxml2)
