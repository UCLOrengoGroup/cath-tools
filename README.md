About
-----

Protein structure tools such as SSAP, as used by the [Orengo Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/orengo-group "Orengo Group website") in the curation of [CATH](http://www.cathdb.info/ "CATH website").

SSAP algorithm (`cath-ssap`) devised by Christine A Orengo and William R Taylor. Please cite: *Protein Structure Alignment*, Taylor and Orengo, Journal of Molecular Biology 208, 1-22, PMID: 2769748.

Since then, many people have contributed to this code, most notably:
  * Tony E Lewis               (2011  - ....)
  * Oliver C Redfern           (~2003 - 2011)
  * James E Bray, Ian Sillitoe (~2000 - 2003)
  * Andrew C R Martin          (considerable edits around 2001)
