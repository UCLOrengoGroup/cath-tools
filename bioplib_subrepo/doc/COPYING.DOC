   Bioplib is a library of routines for the manipulation of protein
structure and sequence using the C programming language.




In these conditions, the term `Bioplib' refers to link libraries, and
to the source code and object code which comprises these
libraries. Should the organisation of the code into libraries change
in the future, the term `Bioplib' will refer to any such link
libraries (and associated source and object code) which comprise the
future release of a package described by the author as `Bioplib'.

The term `compiling' is used to describe the process of compiling and
linking software on a computer to form an executable program.

Bioplib was written by and is copyright (c)1990-1996, Dr. Andrew
C. R. Martin and was mostly written while self-employed. A number of
enhancements and additions have been made since working at University
College London. All copyright and other intellectual property rights
remain with the author. Bioplib may not be used for any purposes other
than as described in the following terms and conditions.






If you have received the Bioplib package directly from the author for
the purposes of compiling your own software, see Section 1 of these
conditions.

If you have received Bioplib as part of another software package, see
Section 2 of these conditions.







Section 1
=========
If you have received the Bioplib package directly from the author:
------------------------------------------------------------------

   If you (the LICENSEE) received Bioplib from the author (Dr. Andrew
C.R. Martin, hereinafter called the LICENSOR) for the purposes of
developing your own software, then you will have signed a licence
agreement. The conditions to which you have agreed are repeated here.

1 Bioplib may only be used by the LICENSEE and members of the
  LICENSEE's laboratory for compiling software provided by the
  LICENSOR and for compiling software developed in the LICENSEE's
  laboratory for research carried out there.  Bioplib will be used
  only by those members of the LICENSEE's laboratory to whom it must
  reasonably be communicated to enable research to be undertaken and
  who agree to be bound by the same conditions.  The LICENSEE shall
  procure and enforce such agreement from members of the LICENSEE's
  laboratory for the benefit of the LICENSOR.

2 The publication of research using software depending on Bioplib 
  must reference the Bioplib library and the LICENSOR. This agreement
  may be taken as permission for citation as a `Personal
  Communication' from the LICENSOR.

3 All software compiled with Bioplib must include reference to Bioplib 
  and the LICENSOR in any copyright messages.

4 All forms of Bioplib will be kept in a reasonably secure place to
  prevent unauthorised access.

5 Bioplib may not be copied for distribution to any third party except
  as expressly described below.

6 The complete Bioplib library may be distributed to third parties,
  unmodified, solely for the purpose of compiling software developed
  by the LICENSEE. The LICENSEE must make clear to the third party in
  the documentation accompanying the LICENSEE's software, that the
  Bioplib library has been supplied by the LICENSOR and that the third
  party may only use Bioplib for the purposes of compiling the
  LICENSEE's software. The third party may not redistribute Bioplib in
  any circumstances except as part of the LICENSEE's software. Third
  parties wishing to use Bioplib as part of their own software should
  contact the LICENSOR.  A file describing these conditions to third
  parties is included with Bioplib.

7 Any modifications or changes made to Bioplib should be sent to
  the LICENSOR for possible inclusion in future versions of
  Bioplib. Any such changes which are incorporated into Bioplib will
  be acknowledged, but become the property of the LICENSOR.

8 Bioplib shall be used exclusively for academic teaching and
  research. Bioplib will not be used for any commercial research or
  research associated with an industrial company unless a separate 
  agreement is made with the LICENSOR.

9 Bioplib may not be used as part of any software which is sold for
  more than a nominal sum to cover copying and distribution
  costs. Should the LICENSEE wish to sell for profit software which
  relies on Bioplib, or any part thereof, then a separate agreement
  must be made with the LICENSOR.







Section 2
=========
If you have received Bioplib as part of another software package:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

   The following conditions apply whether you have received Bioplib
from the author (Dr. Andrew C.R. Martin, hereinafter called the
LICENSOR), or from another source.

   If you have received Bioplib for the purposes of compiling some
other software package (hereinafter called the SOFTWARE PACKAGE) then
you may only use Bioplib in order to compile and link the SOFTWARE
PACKAGE. Bioplib has been provided by the LICENSOR solely for this
purpose.

   You may not use Bioplib to develop your own software and may not
redistribute Bioplib except as part of the SOFTWARE PACKAGE.

   Whether or not, under the conditions of redistribution of the
SOFTWARE PACKAGE, you are permitted to redistribute modifications to
the said SOFTWARE PACKAGE, you are not allowed to redistribute any
modifications or changes to Bioplib. If you do make modifications or
changes to Bioplib as part of a modification you make to the SOFTWARE
PACKAGE for your own purposes, you should send the changes to the
LICENSOR for possible inclusion in a future version of Bioplib. Any
such changes which are incorporated into Bioplib will be acknowledged,
but become the property of the LICENSOR.

   If, under the conditions of redistribution of the SOFTWARE PACKAGE,
you are permitted to redistribute modifications to the said SOFTWARE
PACKAGE, then you must not remove, or modify, any copyright messages
relating to Bioplib.

   If you wish to use Bioplib for the development of your own
software, you should contact the LICENSOR in order to obtain a full
licence agreement.
