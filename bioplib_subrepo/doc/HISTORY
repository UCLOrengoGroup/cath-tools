V2.0
V2.0.1 Fixed bug with ReplaceSideChain() with raw atom names
       Added #define to OpenOrPipe() for systems that don't
       support popen()
V2.0.2 Fixed bug in ReadPDB() handling raw atom names with
       multiple occupancies
V2.0.3-4 Other bugs fixed related to V2.0.2
V2.0.5 Fixed bug in PDB2Seq.c - undercalculated chain length
       by one for CA-only chains
V2.0.6 Fixed a problem in ReadPDB/StoreOccRankAtom() when a lower
       occupancy atom has (erroneously) been set to occupancy
       of zero - this was previously always treated as being an
       occupancy of 1
V2.0.7 Fixed behaviour of HaddPDB() which returned if there was
       a missing carbonyl carbon. Now simply reports the fact.
       Also fixed so that a hydrogen bond cannot be identified
       with a Proline as a backbone nitrogen donor. Also if there
       are missing antecedent atoms it used simply to say no HBond
       now does a distance check and ignores the angle (which 
       can't be calculated). Also fixed error message printing
       Added GlyCB code. This adds (and removes) pseudo-CB atoms to
       glycines for use when structures are being orientated into
       a common frame of reference using a CB.
       Added RemoveAlternates() to ReadPDB.c This is called by the
       ReadPDB() and ReadPDBAtoms() routines to do a full cleanup on
       alternate atom locations. Also added prototypes for popen() and
       pclose() to ReadPDB.c and openorpipe.c to stop compiler warnings
       (esp on 64bit machines)
       New routines IsMCDonorHBonded() and IsMCAcceptorHBonded() in
       hbonds.c
       Modified ExtractZonePDB.c so that it can take non-exact zones
       Added 'ok' to the MEMLIST and added safeleaks() to safemem.c
V2.0.8 Added affinealignuc() and CalcMDMScoreUC() to align.c
V2.0.9 Added support for Unix compress'd files to ReadPDB. Fixes
       to popen() and pclose() prototypes for MAX OS/X
       Added ReadWholePDBAtoms()
V2.0.10 Changes to DupeResiduePDB.c FindAtomWildcardInRes.c
       BuildAtomNeighbourPDBList.c
V2.0.11 Changes to StripWatersPDB.c ReadPDB.c array3.c
--------------------------------------------------------------------
V2.1.1  Added StructurePDB()
