Bioplib is a library of routines for the manipulation of protein
structure and sequence using the C programming language. In addition,
the term `Bioplib' refers to routines for more general C programming
purposes. 


This library is copyright (c) 1990-2003 by Dr. Andrew C.R. Martin and
was almost entirely written while self-employed. Some enhancements
and additional routines written while at UCL and The University
of Reading. For conditions of use, see the file COPYING.DOC.



N.B.
====
Not everything is 100% functional yet. In particular, the curses
windowing routines aren't completely working; everything else is just
about OK. A few general purpose routines are specific for the
Commodore Amiga, but this doesn't affect anything else.

In the V2.0 release, most of these functions have been dropped from
the release version.




INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

1. Create sub-directories of your main directory called include and lib: 

   mkdir ~/include
   mkdir ~/include/bioplib
   mkdir ~/lib

2. Unpack the tar file:

   zcat BiopLibV2.0.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
-or-
   gunzip BiopLibV2.0.tar.gz
   tar -xvf BiopLibV2.0.tar
-or- (if you have Gnu tar)
   tar -zxvf BiopLibV2.0.tar.gz

3. This will create a directory called BiopLibV2.0.  Enter this
directory and then go into the src sub-directory:

   cd BiopLibV2.0/src

Modify the Makefile as required for your system. If you are using the
GNU C compiler and have followed the directions above, no changes
should be needed. If you have chosen alternative locations for the
include and library directories then you will need to change LIBDEST
to be the library directory you have created and INCDEST to the
include directory you have created (N.B. the complete path is
required, you can't do ~/lib).

4. To build the libraries, type:

   make 

The compilation should complete with no errors or warning except for
implicit declarations of popen() in ReadODB.c and ReadWholePDB.c
This is because popen() is not an ANSI C function and the -ansi
flag causes this to be a warning.

5. To install the libraries and the include files, type:

   make install

6. To remove the object files and local copies of the libraries, type:

   make clean

7. If you are using a shell which supports aliases, set up an alias
for the cc command to add the include directory to the include search
path and the lib directory to the lib search path. Using the BASH
shell and assuming you have installed the libraries and include
files in the default location, the following will work:

   alias cc '/bin/cc -I$HOME/include -L$HOME/lib'

If you have chosen an alternative location to install the libraries
and include files, you will need to change the paths for include and
lib. 

You can then compile a program using the command:

   cc -o foo foo.c -lbiop -lgen -lm

Note that -lbiop must appear before -lgen

It is good practice to add flags to enforce the strict ANSI C
standard at the same time (-Wall -ansi -pedantic for GCC or 
-ansi -fullwarn on an SGI).

8. If building a project using a Makefile, then you will need to
include -I$HOME/include -L$HOME/lib in your CFLAGS and remember
to include the libraries (-lbiop -lgen and maybe -lm) at the
end of your link command.

9. To access the C library functions you will need to include
appropriate header files. For example:

#include "bioplib/pdb.h"


DISTRIBUTION AS PART OF ANOTHER PROGRAM
=======================================

When distributing software that relies on Bioplib, you MUST
acknowledge Bioplib. If you are only distributing executables,
you need do nothing more (unless you are distributing for 
money - in which case, see the full licence agreement).

If you are distributing source code, you may include only the 
source files from the library that you require or the complete 
library. In either case, you must:
1. Place all Bioplib source files in a seaparate identifiable
   directory from the rest of your source code
2. Include the files COPYING.DOC and 00PART_DISTRIB_README
   in that directory.
